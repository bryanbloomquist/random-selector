# Random Selector

## Description 
A random selector app created with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.  Click the center button and a random students name is displayed at the top of the page.  The app will cycle through the whole list before re-shuffling and starting over, so everyone will be called upon an equal amount of times.  The current order is also saved in local storage so I can keep going the next time I log on.

## Installation 
If all files are kept in a single folder a web browser should be able to run the project and you have an internet connection.

## Usage 
This app is for me to randomly select students from my boot-camp to answer the next question.
